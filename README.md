**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This is close to 100% vibe-coded by Claude Code.

A Terminal User Interface (TUI) application for processing unparsed recipe ingredients in your Mealie instance.
This tool identifies recipes with unparsed ingredients, uses Mealie's built-in NLP parser to process them, and provides an interactive interface for creating missing units/foods or adding aliases to existing ones.
