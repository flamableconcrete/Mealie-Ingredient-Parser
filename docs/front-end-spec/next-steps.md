# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Review specification with stakeholders** - Share with Mealie community for feedback on batch workflow design and UX approach
2. **Validate accessibility approach** - Test screen reader compatibility with Textual framework using basic prototype
3. **Create Textual CSS theme** - Implement color palette and component styling in Textual CSS file
4. **Prototype PatternGroupScreen** - Build basic table layout to validate performance with large pattern datasets (500+ patterns)
5. **Document keyboard shortcuts** - Create comprehensive shortcut reference for user documentation

## Design Handoff Checklist
