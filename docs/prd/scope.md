# Scope

## Out of Scope for MVP

- AI/ML-powered pattern matching beyond fuzzy text matching
- Bulk recipe deletion or editing features
- Custom Mealie API endpoints or core modifications
- Multi-user concurrent sessions
- Undo/rollback of batch operations (validation and preview-before-commit used instead)

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Undo/rollback operations for batch changes
- Advanced ML-based pattern recognition
- CSV export of unparsed ingredients for external analysis
- Integration with recipe scraping tools for proactive parsing
- Multi-user collaboration features
